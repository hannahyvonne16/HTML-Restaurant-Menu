        <p>
            It all began in Roseville, California. Johnny Bravo had just moved to the northern California town and wanted to impress all the hunnies with his spectacular Thai cooking and surprisingly in-depth knowledge of front end web development. Thus, alongside his mother Bunny Bravo, Johnny opened up H-Thai-ML! And "Whoa, mama!", were all the women, girls, chicks, and babes impressed!
